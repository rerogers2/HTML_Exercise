      <h1>Robert Rogers</h1>
      <p>
        Robert Rogers is a mathematics teacher that is always looking for a
        challenge. He has spent most of his adult life working towards improving
        the intelligence of our young adults. His passion for mathematics began
        at an early age and was a driving force through his educational years.
        He graduated with a Mathematics degree from Texas A&M University. Robert
        stumbled into teaching and used that time to pursue knowledge in other
        fields and grow an interest in programming. He is currently working on
        computer engineering. His goal is to challenge himself further by
        applying his new skills while improving the quality of life for others.

        I looked down at the board. "The <strong>point</strong> isn't to win?" I
        asked. "The <strong>point</strong>," <span>Bredon</span> said grandly,
        "is to <u>play</u> a <em>beautiful</em> game." He lifted his hands and
        shrugged, his face breaking into a beautific smile. "Why would I want to
        win anything other than a <em>beautiful</em> game?"
